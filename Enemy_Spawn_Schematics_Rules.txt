1. The first number represents the ID of the enemy unit to be spawned. Note that the first enemy unit has an ID of 0.
2. The second number represents the amount of times the enemy unit is spawned. -1 is used to indicate that the spawns of that enemy are unlimited.
3. The third number represents the frame that the enemy unit is first spawned. Animation Timers run at 60 frames per second, so divide by 60 to convert to seconds.
4. The fourth and fifth numbers represent the time before each consecutive enemy unit when multiple are spawned as shown by the second number. Since most spawns 
   are timed in a random interval within two bounds, two numbers are used to represent this. When this random aspect is not present, the two numbers are equal.
5. Leave one space at the end of every line and leave one empty line at the end of the text file.
